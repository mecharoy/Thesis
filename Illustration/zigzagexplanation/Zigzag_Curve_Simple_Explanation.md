# How the Zigzag Curve Forms - Simple Explanation

## The Bottom Line

The zigzag curve you see in Figure 2.2 is created by a **cubic polynomial equation**:

```
R(z) = R̂₁ + z·R̂₂ + z²·R̂₃ + z³·R̂₄
```

This is just like the parabola equation you learned in school (y = ax² + bx + c), but with one more power of z added (the z³ term).

## What Makes the Curve Shape

### For Your Pristine Beam (Simplified Values):

```
R(z) = 0 + z·(1.0) + z²·(0) + z³·(-592,593)

Simplified: R(z) = z - 592,593·z³
```

**Breaking this down:**

1. **The z term** (linear): Creates a straight diagonal line
2. **The z³ term** (cubic): Bends that line into a smooth curve

That's it! The curve is basically: **"z minus a very large number times z-cubed"**

## Why Different Curves for Different Layers?

Each layer has **different coefficients** R̂₁ and R̂₂ (the first two terms), but they all share the **same** R̂₃ and R̂₄ (the z² and z³ terms).

**From your actual values:**

| Layer | R̂₁ (constant) | R̂₂ (linear) | R̂₃ (quadratic) | R̂₄ (cubic) |
|-------|---------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Layer 1 (Bottom) | 0.0 | 1.0 | **0.0** | **-592,593** |
| Layer 2 (Middle) | 0.0 | 1.0 | **0.0** | **-592,593** |
| Layer 3 (Top) | 0.0 | 1.0 | **0.0** | **-592,593** |

**Notice:** In your pristine case, all three layers actually have the SAME equation! The curves look different in the plot because they're evaluated over different z-ranges.

## Why This Specific Equation?

The coefficients aren't random. They come from solving these requirements:

1. ✓ **Zero shear stress at top and bottom** (free surfaces)
2. ✓ **Continuous displacement at interfaces** (no gaps)
3. ✓ **Continuous shear stress at interfaces** (no sudden jumps in forces)
4. ✓ **Physical equilibrium** (forces balance)

When you solve these mathematically, you get:

- **R̂₃ = 0** (for symmetric beams, the quadratic term vanishes)
- **R̂₄ = -592,593** (determined by beam geometry and material)
- **R̂₁ = 0, R̂₂ = 1.0** (from normalization)

## What Changes in the Notched Region?

When you add a notch (remove 60% of the material):

**ALL coefficients change!**

| Coefficient | Pristine | Notched | Why? |
|-------------|----------|---------|------|
| R̂₁⁽¹⁾ | 0.0 | ~0.00025 | Shifted neutral axis |
| R̂₂⁽¹⁾ | 1.0 | ~0.5 | Different load distribution |
| R̂₃ | 0.0 | ~0.002 | Broken symmetry |
| R̂₄ | -592,593 | ~-1,500,000 | Less material, higher curvature |

*(Approximate values for illustration)*

This is why the notched curve looks **completely different** - it's literally a different equation!

## The "Zigzag" Effect

**Question:** If it's just a smooth cubic curve, why is it called "zigzag"?

**Answer:** The "zigzag" comes from the **slope changes at layer interfaces**.

Look at the equation for Layer 1:
```
R⁽¹⁾(z) = 0 + z·1.0 + 0·z² + (-592,593)·z³
```

And Layer 2:
```
R⁽²⁾(z) = 0 + z·1.0 + 0·z² + (-592,593)·z³
```

They're the same! But when plotted over their respective z-ranges, they connect at z₁ with:
- Same **value** (continuous)
- Different **slope** (derivative changes)

In composite materials (fibers + epoxy), R̂₂ would be very different between layers, creating visible "zigs" and "zags". In your homogeneous aluminum, the effect is subtle.

## Visual Analogy

Think of building the curve like adding layers to a cake:

```
Start with:      R̂₁         (flat base layer)
Add:            + z·R̂₂      (sloped ramp)
Add:            + z²·R̂₃     (gentle bend)
Add:            + z³·R̂₄     (final curvature)
                ───────
Final result:    Smooth curved line
```

Each "ingredient" (term) adds a different shape characteristic.

## Why Cubic? Why Not Quadratic or 4th Power?

**Mathematical answer:** A cubic polynomial is the **minimum order** needed to satisfy all four boundary conditions (2 at top, 2 at bottom) while maintaining smooth variation.

**Physical answer:** Lower orders (linear, quadratic) can't capture the complexity of shear deformation. Higher orders (4th, 5th power) aren't needed and would make the math unnecessarily complex.

**Engineering answer:** Cubic polynomials give us "just right" accuracy with "just right" computational cost.

## Key Insight for Your Multi-Fidelity Work

**1D Model Assumption:**
```
Displacement = (Euler-Bernoulli part) + R(z)·ψ₀(x)
                                        ↑
                                  This curve!
```

The 1D model **assumes** the displacement follows this specific cubic pattern through thickness.

**2D Model Reality:**

The 2D finite element model **computes** the displacement from scratch without assuming any specific z-dependence.

**The Gap:**

When there's a notch, the 1D assumption breaks down. The actual displacement doesn't follow the cubic pattern anymore. Your U-Net learns to predict this difference.

## To Explain to Others

**For a general audience:**
> "The curve is created by a mathematical formula (a cubic polynomial) that satisfies physical laws like force balance and stress continuity. Think of it like a flexible ruler that bends to touch specific points while staying smooth in between."

**For engineers:**
> "The zigzag function is a piecewise cubic polynomial R(z) = R̂₁ + z·R̂₂ + z²·R̂₃ + z³·R̂₄ derived from enforcing displacement continuity, shear stress continuity, and zero traction boundary conditions. The cubic order is the minimum needed to satisfy all constraints."

**For your thesis defense:**
> "The zigzag displacement field is obtained by solving the variational problem subject to kinematic and stress boundary conditions, yielding layer-wise cubic polynomials. This analytical form enables efficient computation but limits accuracy when geometric discontinuities violate the underlying assumptions, motivating our multi-fidelity deep learning approach."

## The Actual Numbers (Pristine Case)

From the code output:

```
R(z) = 0 + z·(1.0) + z²·(0) + z³·(-592,592.59)
```

**At specific points:**
- At z = -0.75 mm: R = -0.75·(1.0) + (-0.75)³·(-592,592) = -0.75 + 0.25 = **-0.50**
- At z = 0 mm: R = 0·(1.0) + 0³·(-592,592) = **0.0**
- At z = +0.75 mm: R = +0.75·(1.0) + (+0.75)³·(-592,592) = 0.75 - 0.25 = **+0.50**

See the pattern? The linear term dominates, cubic term adds correction.
