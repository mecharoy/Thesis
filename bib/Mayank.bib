abstract = {Lamb wave-based structural health monitoring requires fast and accurate simulation tools for guided wave propagation in structures. In this article, a computationally efficient multiphysics time-domain spectral element (TDSE) model is presented for actuation, propagation, and sensing of Lamb waves in laminated composite strips (beams and panels) integrated with surface-bonded or embedded patch piezoelectric actuators and sensors. The transducers are physically modelled using an electromechanically coupled formulation, which combines an efficient layerwise zigzag theory for kinematics with a layerwise distribution for the electric potential field. The high-order TDSE has n physical nodes containing mechanical and electric degrees of freedom (DOFs) and a separate virtual electric node for modelling the transducersâ€™ equipotential surfaces with significantly reduced DOFs. The continuity of the displacement fields at the intersections (patch fronts) of the hybrid laminate integrated with patch transducers with the host laminate is maintained using the advanced hybrid point-least squares continuity model. The present guided wave predictions show excellent agreement with experimental measurements as well as continuum-based finite element solutions for isotropic and composite strips with surface-bonded piezo patches. The patch front continuity is shown to have a significant effect on the accuracy. The model is used to study the interaction of guided waves with the notch-type damage. The results establish the superiority of the proposed TDSE model over its standard two-node counterpart in terms of accuracy and efficiency. On the other hand, the equivalent single-layer theory-based model with the same number of DOFs yields highly erroneous predictions.}
