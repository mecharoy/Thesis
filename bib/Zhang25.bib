abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of bridges entails the identification and assessment of sudden or cumulative structural damage to ensure the continuous safe operation of bridges through methods such as monitoring techniques, data processing and analysis. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of the various key methods, practical applications and future trends of bridge SHM, emphasizing their current research status in the past five years, which includes an overview of sensing technologies, wireless transmission of data, damage identification methods, prediction and warning models. This paper compares and analyses sensing technologies and focus on reviewing triboelectric nanogenerators. It also discusses wireless transmission methods for data and examines bridge structural damage identification techniques. In addition, the current development status of data preprocessing methods and early warning systems in bridge SHM is summarized. Finally, this review discusses key methods for bridge SHM in relation to the challenges they face and outlines future research directions.}
