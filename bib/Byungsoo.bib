abstract = {The scattering of Lamb waves by a two-dimensional rectangular notch is investigated for rapid inspection of defects in a structure. To derive the reflection and transmission coefficients of the scattered waves in a simple way, the scattering caused by the notch is analyzed through the composition of individual scattering processes. Linear equations corresponding to the reflection and transmission coefficients are constructed along with scattering graphs. For an illustration of the efficacy of the presented method, the scattering of fundamental symmetric and anti-symmetric modes are inspected according to the depth and width of a notch in a plate. Validity of these expressions is demonstrated by the comparison of the theoretical analysis results with those from the finite element analysis.}
