abstract = {Engineering applications of swarm intelligence optimization algorithms have been widely employed to identify structural systems and damages owing to their merits of simplicity, flexibility, robustness etc., while they often suffer from the defects of slow efficiency, premature convergence or even trapping into local optima in solving the inverse problem of nonlinear optimization-based parameter identification with partial noise-contaminated measurements. To deal with this issue, an adaptive hybrid Jaya and differential evolution (AHJDE) algorithm is proposed based on Jaya algorithm and differential evolution (DE) by effectively combining the advantages of both algorithms. In the proposed AHJDE, four improvements including adaptive mutation strategy, dynamic mutation and crossover operators, sampling-based resizing search space and linear resizing population size are integrated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using a numerical example of 20-DOF linear system by comparing its performance with particle swarm optimization, modified artificial bee colony algorithm, clustering tree seeds algorithm, improved butterfly optimization algorithm etc. considering known mass case and unknown mass case. In addition, numerical studies on a nonlinear single degree-of-freedom system with classical Bouc-Wen hysteretic model and improved Bouc-Wen model are implemented to investigate the applicability in the field of nonlinear system identification. Finally, a series of experimental tests on a five-story steel frame structure are conducted in the laboratory to further validate the performance of the proposed approach in damage identification. Identification results demonstrate the proposed AHJDE can accurately and effectively identify the unknown system parameters and damages with limited sensors and noise-polluted responses.}
