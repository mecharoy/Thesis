## 1. REPETITIONS ACROSS CHAPTERS

### 1.1 Computational Speedup Claims - Critical Repetition

**Issue**: Duplicate and triplicate documentation of identical speedup figures across multiple chapters.

**Chapter 1 (Introduction) - First Instance:**
- Lines 175-177: "surrogate models achieving speedups of 6 orders of magnitude (10^6 times faster)"
- Lines 199-201: "$10^6 to 10^7 times more efficient execution"

**Chapter 1 (Introduction) - Second Instance (Redundant):**
- Lines 208-209: "3–10× speedups and a 54% reduction in high-fidelity data needs via transfer learning"

**Contradiction**: The document claims both 10^6-10^7× speedups AND 3-10× speedups without contextual clarification.

**Chapter 3 (Dataset)**:
- Lines 1522: "one-dimensional zigzag implementations execute approximately 8 times faster"

**Problem**: Three different speedup metrics (10^6-10^7, 3-10×, 8×) are presented without reconciliation.

### 1.2 Material Properties Repetition

**Chapter 1 (Introduction) - Lines 179-180:**
```
density ρ = 2700 kg/m³
elastic modulus E = 7.0 × 10^10 Pa
Poisson's ratio ν = 0.33
```

**Chapter 3 (Dataset) - Lines 1379-1380:**
```
density ρ = 2700 kg/m³
elastic modulus E = 7.0 × 10^10 Pa
Poisson's ratio ν = 0.33
```

**Issue**: Identical material property descriptions repeated verbatim without contextual justification.

### 1.3 Excitation Signal Characteristics Repetition

**Chapter 3 (Dataset) - Multiple Occurrences:**
- Lines 1389-1398: Complete Hanning-windowed 5-cycle sine burst description
- Lines 1443-1450: Reference to 100 kHz frequency without new information
- Figure captions repeat same information

**Impact**: Redundant descriptions waste space without adding analytical value.

## 2. CONTRADICTIONS ACROSS CHAPTERS

### 2.1 Dataset Size Inconsistencies

**Critical Mathematical Contradiction in Dataset Reporting:**

**Chapter 3 Claims:**
- Low-fidelity: "750 primary damage training cases" (Line 1458)
- High-fidelity: "100 carefully selected damage configurations" (Line 1472)
- Total LF: "complete low-fidelity dataset comprises 850 simulation cases" (Line 1466)
- Total HF: "complete high-fidelity dataset encompasses 100 damage training cases" (Line 1483)

**Chapter 4 Claims:**
- "HFSM training from scratch requires 100 high-fidelity training cases" (Line 2334)
- "pretraining on 750 1D cases" for LFSM (Line 2389)
- Figure 4.3 caption: "HFSM (right, training from scratch on 500 2D cases)" (Line 2385)

**Contradiction**: Chapter 4 claims 500 HF training cases while Chapter 3 states only 100 HF cases.

### 2.2 Training Time Claims Contradiction

**Chapter 3 (Dataset):**
- Line 1515: "approximately 25-30s for time integration phase and about 45s in total per case" (LF)
- Lines 1519-1520: "approximately 1700-2000s (28.3-33.3 minutes) per case" (HF)

**Chapter 4 (Methodology):**
- Line 2391: "Each training case requires approximately 10 minutes of processing time, making MFSM approach computationally efficient"

**Chapter 5 (Results):**
- Line 2334: "Each training case requires approximately 45 minutes of processing time"
- Line 2539: "optimization process requires approximately 10 minutes per case for convergence"

**Problem**: Multiple inconsistent time measurements without context clarification.

### 2.3 Performance Metrics Contradictions

**Chapter 5 (Results) - Mathematical Errors:**

**Percentage Improvement Calculation Error:**
- Line 2321: "MFSM achieves a highest R² score of 0.9713, representing a 10.6% improvement over HFSM"
  - ACTUAL calculation: (0.9713 - 0.8781) / 0.8781 = 10.6% ✓
- Line 2321: "16.7% improvement over LFSM"
  - ACTUAL calculation: (0.9713 - 0.8324) / 0.8324 = 16.7% ✓
- Line 2461: "MFSM dramatically outperforms HFSM with an R² of 0.9590 compared to 0.5377—a 78% improvement in accuracy"
  - ACTUAL calculation: (0.9590 - 0.5377) / 0.5377 = 78.4% ✓

**But**: Line 2458 contradicts earlier values, claiming HFSM R² = 0.5377 vs. Table 5.1 value of 0.8781.

## 3. INCONSISTENCIES ACROSS CHAPTERS

### 3.1 Mathematical Notation Inconsistencies

**Malformed Notation in Chapter 2:**
- Line references: "10e{-5}" format appears instead of "10^{-5}" in zigzag theory formulations

**Dimensional Inconsistencies:**
- Chapter 3: Notch depth ranges from "0.0001 meters to 0.001 meters"
- Chapter 5: Reference to "notch depth of 0.2 mm" (0.0002 m) vs. "0.9 mm" (0.0009 m)
- Mixing of meters and millimeters without consistent units

### 3.2 Autoencoder Architecture Inconsistencies

**Chapter 2 Description:**
- Claims "non-conditional autoencoders trained on 1D zigzag responses"

**Chapter 4 Implementation:**
- Describes "response-only training paradigm" where encoder-decoder learns from response data only
- But Chapter 4 also mentions: "An alternative parameter-conditional architecture, where both responses and parameters feed into encoder"

**Inconsistency**: Theoretical description doesn't match implementation details.

### 3.3 Sensor Configuration Inconsistencies

**Chapter 3 (Dataset):**
- Line 1447: "x_sensor = [1.85, 1.87, 1.9, 1.92, 1.95, 1.97, 2.0, 2.02, 2.05, 2.1] meters" (10 sensors)

**Chapter 5 (Results):**
- Multiple figures show responses from "11 sensor points" (Line 2394: 11 sensor points mentioned)

**Problem**: Sensor count discrepancy (10 vs. 11) across chapters.

## 4. FLOW AND PROGRESSION ISSUES

### 4.1 Missing Bridge Between Chapters 2 and 3

**Gap**: Chapter 2 develops extensive theoretical framework for zigzag theory, but Chapter 3 jumps directly to dataset generation without:
- Justification for parameter bounds selection
- Connection between theoretical assumptions and experimental setup
- Validation of theoretical applicability to homogeneous beams with notches

### 4.2 Abrupt Transition from Forward to Inverse Problems

**Missing Connection**: Chapter 5 transitions from forward problem results to inverse problem without:
- Logical justification for inverse problem formulation
- Connection between forward model accuracy and inverse problem feasibility
- Discussion of uniqueness and identifiability issues

### 4.3 Insufficient Cross-Reference Integration

**Issue**: Limited use of cross-references between chapters:
- Performance metrics in Chapter 5 not connected to methodology choices in Chapter 4
- Dataset characteristics from Chapter 3 not linked to training strategies in Chapter 4
- Theoretical foundations from Chapter 2 not referenced in validation approaches

---

## 5. MATHEMATICAL AND TECHNICAL ERRORS

### 5.1 Percentage Improvement Calculations

**Location**: Chapter 5, Results section
**Error**: While most percentage calculations are correct, presentation creates confusion about baseline comparisons
**Impact**: Claims appear exaggerated due to inconsistent baseline selection

### 5.2 Unmatched Parentheses and Mathematical Syntax

**Chapter 2**: Multiple instances of unmatched parentheses in algorithm descriptions
**Chapter 4**: Mathematical notation inconsistencies in loss function formulations

### 5.3 Statistical Significance Missing

**Critical Omission**: No statistical significance testing reported for:
- Performance differences between models
- Improvement claims
- Generalization capability across different damage scenarios

---

## 6. MISSING CONNECTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES

### 6.1 Theoretical-Experimental Link Missing

**Opportunity**: No explicit connection between Chapter 2 theoretical framework and Chapter 3 experimental design:
- How zigzag theory assumptions influence dataset parameter selection
- Validation of theoretical predictions against preliminary experiments
- Discussion of theory limitations and experimental accommodations

### 6.2 Multi-Fidelity Integration Rationale

**Gap**: Insufficient justification for multi-fidelity approach:
- No clear comparison with single-fidelity alternatives
- Missing cost-benefit analysis
- Limited discussion of when multi-fidelity is preferable

### 6.3 Inverse Problem-Forward Model Integration

**Missing Link**: Weak connection between forward model accuracy and inverse problem success:
- No analysis of forward model error propagation to inverse solutions
- Missing discussion of identifiability challenges
- Limited connection between reconstruction quality and parameter estimation accuracy
